## Exhaustive list of features
### Localizer
ComAbilities comes prepackaged with a localizer, allowing for the text within the plugin to be modified easily. Language files are generated when the plugin is first run (default localizations will be used), in the EXILED configs folder. The current language file in use can be configured by changing the `Localization` config - for example, `English` will set the current localization file to be `English.yml`. The .yml files inside the folder can be modified freely.
### Abilities
#### Reality Scrambler
While active, the Reality Scrambler regenerates the Hume Shield of all SCPs, regardless of whether or not they are taking damage. However, it drains Aux Power and prevents regeneration of it.

Site-02 features █ Scranton Reality Anchors, powerful devices that can nullify the abilities of reality-benders. However, in order to facilitate testing, these can be remotely disabled. Doing so greatly increases the reality-bending powers of the various anomalies with the site, so authorization from the Facility Manager is required.

As part of an effort to combat the increasing number of breaches by SCP-106, SCP-173, and SCP-████, a network of sensors, light detectors, and other devices was installed within the facility to act as a support system to the Breach Scanner. Known as the PLAYER Tracker, this system allows for real-time monitoring and tracking of anomalies, although it has been utilized against hostile GOI forces and rogue personnel.
